'  MaestroEasyExampleVb:
'    Simple example GUI for the Maestro USB Servo Controller, written in
'    Visual Basic .NET.
'    
'    Features:
'       Temporary native USB connection using Usc class.
'       Button for disabling channel 0.
'       Button for setting target of channel 0 to 1000 us.
'       Button for setting target of channel 0 to 2000 us.
' 
'  NOTE: Channel 0 should be configured as a servo channel for this program
'  to work.  You must also connect USB and servo power, and connect a servo
'  to channel 0.  If this program does not work, use the Maestro Control
'  Center to check what errors are occurring.
