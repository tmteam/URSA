/*  MaestroEasyExample:
 *    Simple example GUI for the Maestro USB Servo Controller, written in
 *    Visual C#.
 *    
 *    Features:
 *       Temporary native USB connection using Usc class
 *       Button for disabling channel 0.
 *       Button for setting target of channel 0 to 1000 us.
 *       Button for setting target of channel 0 to 2000 us.
 * 
 *  NOTE: Channel 0 should be configured as a servo channel for this program
 *  to work.  You must also connect USB and servo power, and connect a servo
 *  to channel 0.  If this program does not work, use the Maestro Control
 *  Center to check what errors are occurring.
